# Overview

## The Challenge:

Create an interfaces that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in an SQL Employee Tracker database. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Objective is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Once done, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates the interfaces functionality and acceptance criteria + BONUS acceptance criteria.
